This directory contains implementations of LU factorization without pivoting
as well as a simple test driver.

Steps:
======

1) In the makefile, set up the paths to where you have the libflame and BLAS
   libraries are installed.

2) Choose your compiler. By default, the gcc compiler will be used.

3) Run 'make' to compile.

4) Run 'make test' to execute the test driver, leaving the output in file
   'output.m'

5) If you start up matlab and execute 'output', the output generated by the
   test driver will automatically plot the performance.

Enjoy.
