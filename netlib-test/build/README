This is a modified netlibs test suite that is using either the lapack2flame or lapack2flash interface.
This test suite is only built by the libflame makefile if one of these options are selected.
This test is removed in a 'make clean' is run on libflame

Below is an example of how to run this test:
#ln -s ../../lib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/libflame.so liblapack.so
#ln -s PATH_TO_YOUR_BLAS/libblis.so libblas.so
#export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=LOCATION_OF_YOUR_BLAS:LOCATION_OF_YOUR_LAPACK
#make -j

This should result with something like the following results:
