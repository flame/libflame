# libflame library

libflame is a portable library for dense matrix computations, providing
complete functionality present in LAPACK, developed by current and
former members of the
[Science of High-Performance Computing](http://shpc.ices.utexas.edu/)
(SHPC) group in the
[Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences](https://www.ices.utexas.edu/)
at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).
In addtion, AMD is actively  optimizing some of the key routines in libFLAME
for AMD Zen core based architectures in the "amd" fork of libFLAME
hosted on github:
  https://github.com/amd/libflame

For detailed instructions on how to configure, build, install, and link
against libflame on AMD CPUs, please refer to the AOCL User Guide on 
  https://developer.amd.com/amd-aocl

Upstream repository contains libflame reference manual that has  all the 
information you need to get started with libflame, including 
installation directions, usage examples, and a complete API reference. 
If you have LaTeX installed on your system, you may simply change into 
the 'docs/libflame' subdirectory of the top-level directory of the 
libflame source tree and build the document from its source. You may also 
find a copy of the document [here](docs/libflame/libflame.pdf) on github.

You can keep in touch with developers and other users of the project by

- For any issues/suggestion in the "amd" fork of libFLAME, please email
  to toolchainsupport@amd.com
- [libflame-discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/libflame-discuss)
Please join and post to this mailing list if you have general questions
or feedback regarding libflame.
