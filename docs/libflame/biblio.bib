                  high-performance algorithms for well-studied linear algebra operations

  abstract =     "In this paper, we present a number of Application Program
                 Interfaces (APIs) for coding linear algebra algorithms.  On the
                 surface, these APIs for the MATLAB M-script and C programming
                 languages appear to be simple, almost trivial, extensions of those
                 languages.  Yet with them, the task of programming and maintaining
                 families of algorithms for a broad spectrum of linear algebra
                 operations is greatly simplified.  In combination with our Formal
                 Linear Algebra Methods Environment (FLAME) approach to deriving such
                 families of algorithms, dozens of algorithms for a single linear
                 algebra operation can be derived, verified to be correct, implemented,
                 and tested, often in a matter of minutes per algorithm.  Since the
                 algorithms are expressed in code much like they are explained in a
                 classroom setting, these APIs become not just a tool for implementing
                 libraries, but also a valuable tool for teaching the algorithms that
                 are incorporated in the libraries.  In combination with an extension
                 of the Parallel Linear Algebra Package (PLAPACK) API, the approach
                 presents a migratory path from algorithm to MATLAB implementation to
                 high-performance sequential implementation to parallel implementation.
                 Finally, the APIs are being used to create a repository of algorithms
                 and implementations for linear algebra operations, the FLAME Interface
                 REpository (FIRE), which already features hundreds of algorithms for
                 dozens of commonly encountered linear algebra operations.",

                 presented, the correctness of the algorithms carries through to the
                 correctness of the implementations.  Analytically motivated heuristics
                 are used to subsequently choose members from the family that can be
                 expected to yield high performance.  Finally, we report performance on
                 the Intel (R) Pentium (R) III processor that is competitive with that
                 of recursive algorithms reported previously in the literature for this

                 computation and updating of QR factorizations of dense matrices, including 
                 problems large enough to require out-of-core computation, where the matrix 
                 is stored on disk. The algorithms presented here are scalable both in 
                 problem size and as the number of processors increases. Implementation 
                 using the Parallel Linear Algebra Package (PLAPACK) and the Parallel 
                 Out-of-Core Linear Algebra Package (POOCLAPACK) is discussed. The methods 
                 are shown to attain excellent performance, in some cases attaining roughly 
                 80 percent of the  realizable peak of the architectures on which the 
                 experiments were performed.",

                 matrix, and finally the multiplication of the inverted triangular matrix by its own transpose. We
                 state different algorithms for each of these sweeps as well as algorithms that compute the result
                 in a single sweep. One algorithm outperforms the current ScaLAPACK implementation by 20-30
                 percent due to improved load-balance on a distributed memory architecture.",

  abstract={The emergence and continuing use of multi-core architectures and graphics processing units require changes in the existing software and sometimes even a redesign of the established algorithms in order to take advantage of now prevailing parallelism. Parallel Linear Algebra for Scalable Multi-core Architectures (PLASMA) and Matrix Algebra on GPU and Multics Architectures (MAGMA) are two projects that aims to achieve high performance and portability across a wide range of multi-core architectures and hybrid systems respectively. We present in this document a comparative study of PLASMA's performance against established linear algebra packages and some preliminary results of MAGMA on hybrid multi-core and GPU systems.}
