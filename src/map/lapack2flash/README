lapack2flash
============

This directory includes lapack2flash layer which provides backward compatibility
to FORTRAN LAPACK interface using FLASH. The entire LAPACK source files are converted to C
files using code translator F2C pointed to in the lapack2flame directory.
However, libf2c is not required when libflame is linked.

Directory structure
-------------------

lapack2flash
  - check               :: Symbolic link to the directory in lapack2flamec/
  - f2c                 :: Symbolic link to the directory in lapack2flamec/

  + FLASH_*.c           :: LAPACK interfaces that redirect functionality to libflame using FLASH calls.


How to use
----------

configuration:

  Modify the default run-conf/run-configure.sh with the following changes

  ./configure \
            --enable-lapack2flash \
            --enable-supermatrix \
            --enable-multithreading=pthreads \

Note that supermatrix is required for lapack2flash

LAPACK test suite
-----------------

Follow lapack2flame's test procedures.

FLAPACK interface structure
---------------------------

lapack2flash uses the same structure as lapack2flame. Operations are
replaced with their FLASH equivalents. Doing so optionally allows for GPU acceleration
when configured correctly. Set functions allow for setting number of threads, 
depth (only a depth of 1 is currently supported), and blocksize. See below for
supported interfaces. If an interface is not FLASH supported, it is simply using
the lapack2flame call. 

Using FLASH:
FLASH_potrf
FLASH_potri
FLASH_trsyl
FLASH_trtri
FLASH_lauum
