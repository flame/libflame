/*! @brief Partial LDL' factorization without pivoting
    *
    * @details
    * \b Purpose:
    * \verbatim
        DSPFFRTX computes the partial factorization of a real symmetric matrix A
        stored in packed format.
        The factorization has the form
            A = L*D*L**T
        where L is a lower triangular matrix, and D is a diagonal matrix.
        This is an unblocked algorithm.
        The algorthm does not do pivoting and does not handle zero diagonal elements.
        Hence, it may give unexpected outputs for certain inputs.
    \endverbatim

    * @param[in,out] ap
    ap is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
    On entry, the lower triangle of the symmetric matrix A, packed columnwise in a 
    linear array. The j-th column of A is stored in the array AP as follows:
            AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
    On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
    to obtain the factor L, stored as a packed triangular matrix overwriting A
    (see below for further details).

    * @param[in] n
    n is integer*. \n
    The order of the matrix A. *n >= 0

    * @param[in] ncolm
    ncolm is integer*. \n
    The number of columns / rows to be factorized. 0 <= *ncolm <= *n

    * @param[in] work
    work is DOUBLE PRECISION array. \n
    Currently an unused buffer

    * @param[in] work2
    work2 is DOUBLE PRECISION array. \n
    Currently an unused buffer

   ===================

    * \verbatim
    If input matrix A is of the form,

        ( a  b**T )
    A = (         )
        ( b    C  ), where

    a is the first diagonal element  A, b is a column vector of size n - 1 containing the
    elements from the first column of A excluding the diagonal element,
    C is the lower-right square submatrix of A, and I is the identity matrix,
    then DSPFFRTX performs ncolm successive factorizations of the form:

        ( a  b**T )   (  1   0 )   (  a        0       )   ( 1  (b/a)**T )
    A = (         ) = (        ) * (                   ) * (             )
        ( b    C  )   ( b/a  I )   (  0   C-b*1/a*b**T )   ( 0      I    )
